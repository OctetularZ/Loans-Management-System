## Loans Management System  
**Technologies:** Java, OOP, Abstract Classes, Interfaces

Created a loans management system for a concept bank. Leveraged Java libraries such as `ArrayList` for storing customer information and `Regex` for input validation (e.g., checking if input is numeric).

This project earned me an exceptionally high mark and served as a major turning point in my development with Java. I was required to follow strict project guidelines, including:

- Representing customer information in a **tabular format**
- Implementing a specific format for **customer IDs**

### Key Outcomes:
- Strengthened my **time management** and **critical thinking** skills  
- Improved my ability to **develop software under specific client requirements**
