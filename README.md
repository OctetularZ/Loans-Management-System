# Loans Management System

(Java, OOP, Abstract classes, Interfaces)

Created a loans management system for university coursework for a concept bank.
Learnt and utilised libraries like ArrayList for storing a customer’s information and Regex for validation (checking if an input is numeric).

This project scored me an exceptionally high mark and was the catalyst for my major development in Java. I was also required to follow specific guidelines/criteria when constructing the loans system such as representing a customer’s information in a tabular format and following a specific format for customer IDs.

This academic project greatly improved my time management and critical thinking skills and also my ability to work under a client’s requirements.
